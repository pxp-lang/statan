# Statan

Statan is an early-stage static analyser for PHP and [PXP](https://pxplang.org) projects. It is being developed in public and the journey is documented on [my blog](https://ryangjchandler.co.uk/posts/writing-a-static-analyser-for-php-in-rust-overview).

The long-term goal is to have an incredibly fast static analyser that is comparable to PHPStan and Psalm in terms of features and capabilities.

In it's current state, the project is not suitable for any form of production use, but experiments are encourage and feedback is welcome. There's no guarantee of project stability at this point in time, so things might explode when you try it out.
